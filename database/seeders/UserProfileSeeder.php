                    I am Habibi Ahmad Aziz, a student of SMKN 1 Karawang who is very interested in the world of programming. I have a strong interest in becoming a Fullstack Web Developer.
                    My journey in the IT world began two years ago, and since then, I have continued to expand my knowledge and skills by going through live projects, seeking and obtaining certifications through various bootcamp programs or other programs. I specialize in various tech stacks such as JavaScript, Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, PHP, Laravel, mysql and others and have experience building web applications from frontend to backend.
                    I always want to learn new technologies and solve real-world problems through the code I create. My goal is to develop innovative and impactful digital solutions that can benefit others.
